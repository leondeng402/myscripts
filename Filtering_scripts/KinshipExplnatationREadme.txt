I have also uploaded an Excel file with a table that contains the results of kinship analysis for your families on the exome data. The analysis was done using the algorithm detailed here:
http://people.virginia.edu/~wc9c/KING/manual.html
The publication reference is at the bottom of the page.
Basically the algorithm takes the data for 2 individuals (columns B&C) and outputs a “Kinship Coefficient” (Column H) which can be used to infer the degree of relatedness (Columns E (expected) and J (Inferred)): for an individual with her/himself or monozygotic twins the coefficient would be 0.5; for parent/child, sibling/sibling, it would be 0.25; for grandparent/grandchild, aunt/niece etc. it would be 0.125… and so, that is dividing by two for each additional degree of relatedness. There is a secondary table on the second worksheet that gives some examples. Note that (a) these numbers (0.25, 0.125 etc.) are ideals, what we get is a bit more rough so there is some (as yet undetermined) margin for error, and (b) I am not convinced about the accuracy after about 4 or 5 degrees of separation, that is I am not sure we can be sure X is the 2nd cousin once removed and not just a 2nd Cousin, however, numbers less than 0 are, I think, fairly certain indicators of non-relatedness
Additionally, we have check the chromosomal sex of each individual. 
I have highlighted any issues.
